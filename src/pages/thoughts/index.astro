        <p>
          I spend most of my days with fleeting thoughts. Writing.
          <br />
          Listening. And collecting old Beach cruisers. The
          <br />
          morning rides keep me on a hill of silence.
        </p>
        <p>I go months without a phone.</p>
        <p>
          Love, loss, and grief have disturbed my comfort zone,
          <br />
          but the glimmers of God speak through my music
          <br />
          and family.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the world around me evolves, I reflect on what
          <br />
          matters the most. The life in which my words will
          <br />
          land next.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s beauty in completion. And always faith in
          <br />
          the unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for keeping me in your thoughts. I’ve prayed
          <br />
          for you all.
        </p>
        <p>See you soon.</p>
